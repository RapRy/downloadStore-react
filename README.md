### Download Portal (ReactJs)
> This is the react version of the **[Download Portal](https://github.com/RapRy/dlPortal)**, the only difference between the two version is that I didn't implemented the admin features and also there are few minor changes on this version. It's still not fully responsive like the prior version. I also developed my own Rest Api for this project, check below for the link of the api.
